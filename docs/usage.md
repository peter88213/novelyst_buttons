A [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) plugin providing buttons for frequently used actions. 

---

# Installation

If [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) is installed, the setup script auto-installs the *novelyst_buttons* plugin in the *novelyst* plugin directory.

## Options

### Select icon size

Default is **Small icons** (16x16 pixels). You can select **Big icons** (24x24 pixels), if you like. 

### Disable the hovertips

Hovertips are small text windows that display the command when the mouse pointer hovers over the icon. 
They are enabled by default. If you don't need them, you can save system resources by ticking the 
**Disable the hovertips** checkbox.

**Note:** Hovertips will only show up if you have the *idlelib* package installed. If not, a warning 
message is displayed during setup. However, the plugin still works.
